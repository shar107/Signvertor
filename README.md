# Signvertor | [📝](https://www.irjmets.com/paperdetail.php?paperId=483e95ea8f80aa64d0e45e11b010725d&title=SignvertorA+Hearing+Aid+Module+For+The+Deaf&authpr=Sharadindu+Adhikari)

The most natural and expressive method for hearing-impaired people is sign language. Despite the fact that sign language is sufficient for communication between hearing impaired persons, there is an issue when nondisabled people attempt to interact with the hearing impaired. This study demonstrates a mechanism that can translate speech and text from a normal person into sign language using Indian Sign Language (ISL). 3D animations are used to express the Sign Language. The project follows HCI Principles and is created as a Web and Mobile application. The development process employs the Agile methodology, and users provide in-depth feedback and participate in surveys.

### Working

>- Front-end using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
>- Speech recognition using JavaScript Web speech API.
>- Text Preprocessing using Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK).
>- A 3D animation of a character created using 3D animation tool.
>- Proper Documentation and User Guide.
>- Tutorial for learning Indian Sign Language.


### Prerequisites
